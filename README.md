# Pedestrian-Detection-Smart-Car
This smart RC car focuses on detecting something is in its path and stops before hitting it. The goal was to create a system that reacts quickly and safely when a person or object is nearby. Using a microcontroller and a motion sensor, the car is able to sense movement in front of it and stop its motors in time.
